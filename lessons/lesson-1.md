# Lesson 1 - Connect to the robot and run a mode

This lesson will show you the following
* See your first Java Code for the Robot
* Show you the basic structure of how the Robot is controlled
* Connect to the Robot and run the code on it


## See your First Java Code


## Show Basic Structure of how the Robot is controlled
* Robot stuctures are set up in the RobotContainer
* Robot Commands are set up in the RobotContainer
* Robot Structures are passed into the Commands
* Commands perform actions on the Structures

## Connect to The Robot and Run code on it

### Connect to your Robot
To connect to you robot you will need to change your wifi. Look for you robot name (romi-n where n is the number) in your wifi connections and connect to it. You will need a password for the wifi it is WPILib2021!

### Run your code on the robot
In VS Code hit ctrl-shift-p this will open an prompt type simulate you will see a command Simulate Robot Code, select this. It will build your code and pop open an window labeled Robot Simulation. In the Robot State window select Autonomous

Look, you should see a yellow led light up on the ROMI. GREAT it works. If you missed it don't worry, click Disabled and Autonomous again.

Close the window 

You are done with Lesson 1
